# TASEPy
TASEPy is a python package providing a numerical solution for the inhomogeneous Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) in the stationary state. The package provides an implementation of the Power Series Approximation (PSA) introduced in [1,2]. The iterative solution proposed here is detailed in the affiliated paper [3].

A short tutorial is given in this [python notebook](<demos/tutorial_TASEPy.ipynb>).

All numerical methods are implemented in Python 3.
