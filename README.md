# TASEPy
TASEPy is a python package providing a numerical solution for the inhomogeneous Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) in the stationary state. The TASEP is a paradigmatic lattice model for one-dimensional particle transport subject to excluded-volume interactions. The package TASEPy provides an implementation of the Power Series Approximation (PSA) introduced in [1,2] for solving the TASEP in the limit in which the initiation rate at which new particles are added to the lattice is small. The iterative solution proposed here is detailed in the affiliated paper [3].

A short tutorial is given in this [python notebook](<demos/tutorial_TASEPy.ipynb>).

All numerical methods are implemented in Python 3.
